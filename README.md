# Hmmm
This library is mainly made for my mods, buy you can use it in your mod

## How to use in your mods
Go to my [maven](https://github.com/Progames723/maven) repo

### basic usage
on forge make the mod load before the library and listen to the `HmmmLibraryLoadEvent`<p>
on fabric implement the `HmmmLibraryEntrypoint` and do
```json
"hmmm_library": [
	"your.entrypoint.Class"
]
```

# TODO
